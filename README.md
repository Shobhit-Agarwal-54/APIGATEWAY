FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END- BACKEND

We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices.
Using this middle-end when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to such requests.
We can do message validation , response transformation, rate limiting
We try to prepare an API gateway that acts as this middle-end.
